I will publish his words verbatim, but with some editing, for grammatical reasons:   “Osasu, good evening. I you are enjoying the #AFCON IN CIV, with its full share of surprises… I understand BAT (@officialABAT) is coming with a delegation comprising governors, members of @nassnigeria and other hangers-on, to watch the #TotalEnergiesAFCON2023 final, with billions [of Naira] going to service their needs, to the detriment of the poor in the country. Those characters must begin to give sports in Nigeria its rightful place and FUND its development sufficiently well, because it is the only thing that brings pride to our nation in the comity of nations… Imagine that the whole sports budget for 2024 being a paltry 28 billion Naira a year, the lowest of any Ministry. How on earth do you provide facilities, discover and develop talent, run competitions, etc with that “chicken change”? Government must do a supplementary budget after the AFCON win on Sunday(hopefully) to at least 150 Billion for this year, increasing yearly to reach 250 Billion in 2027. Even at that,the allocation would not be in the top 10 ministries!! Find a way to get this across to @NigeriaGov, in your usual precise presentation.”","Feb 9, 2024 · 8:04 PM UTC",587,74

If it were #Morocco or #Senegal, they would surely be transparent by letting stakeholders know how they intend to invest these funds in the various aspects of the game. But trust us, nothing of such would be disclosed. Please put them to the test.”  I will do my best. 🙂","Feb 9, 2024 · 8:15 PM UTC",239,7
